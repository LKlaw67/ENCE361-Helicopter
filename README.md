# Helicopter Embedded System
This project was part of ENCE361 and required the behaviour of a remote controlled helicopter to be programmed on a TIVA board in groups of two.
The quality of the code ensured all functions were suitable met.

## Functions
The main goal of this project was to develop efficient and modularised code in a group setting.
THe helicopter must complete the following functions:
* Find a direction in which to take off.
* Rise to an altitiude where stable, manoeuvrable flight can be maintained.
* Rotate around a fixed position and over several incremental steps.
* Land back at base, "parking" in a home position.
